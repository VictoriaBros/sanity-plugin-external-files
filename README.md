# sanity-plugin-external-files

Series of plugins for working with media files hosted elsewhere inside of Sanity.

## Existing implementations

List of vendors currently supported:

- AWS S3 -> [sanity-plugin-s3-files](https://github.com/hdoro/sanity-plugin-external-files/tree/main/packages/aws)
- Google Firebase -> [sanity-plugin-firebase-files](https://github.com/hdoro/sanity-plugin-external-files/tree/main/packages/firebase)
- DigitalOcean Spaces -> [sanity-plugin-digital-ocean-files](https://github.com/hdoro/sanity-plugin-external-files/tree/main/packages/digital-ocean)
- Cloudflare R2 -> [@victoriabros/sanity-cf-dam-plugin](https://github.com/hdoro/sanity-plugin-external-files/tree/main/packages/cloudflare-r2)

Use one of the existing implementations or write your own!

## Creating your own implementation

I'm yet to properly document how to create your own implementation, so please reach out if you're looking into doing it! You can get a hold of me at [opensource@hdoro.dev](mailto:opensource@hdoro.dev).

While that documentation gets sorted out, be sure to take a look at the configuration for the [Firebase plugin](https://github.com/hdoro/sanity-plugin-external-files/blob/main/packages/firebase/src/config.ts) and for the [S3 plugin](https://github.com/hdoro/sanity-plugin-external-files/blob/main/packages/aws/src/config.ts). The core plugin does the heavy lifting: the full implementation of the DigitalOcean plugin is 330 lines of code, including types and documentation âœ¨

## Roadmap

From my own standpoint and use cases, this _plugin is feature complete_.

That said, I'm willing to develop it further given the interest and resources. Here's a list of features and improvements we could pursue:

- **Synchronizing files** uploaded to vendors outside of Sanity
  - âœ¨ Solves: this would make it possible to have multiple entries to your storage buckets and using Sanity as the single source of truth. A significantly better experience than opening AWS S3's console and managing files there, for example.
  - This actually doesn't involve much code on the plugin side. It'd be more about providing a blessed path for implementing webhooks in a simpler way by developers.
  - If you already have this demand, just take a look at your used plugin's schema and try to build a handler for new files in your vendor that creates documents in Sanity following that schema.
- Previews for PDFs and other file types
- **New vendors**, such as Supabase and Storj.io

## Contributing

To get the project working locally:

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm i` from the root directory
   - pnpm@9.11 or higher is required - refer to [their installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation)
   - This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) as a monorepo manager. From a single dev command you'll be working across all packages and the test studio.
2. Populate the test studio's `.env` file with your keys, following the `.env.example` file.
   - You'll need to create or select a Sanity project
   - For each vendor, you'll need to create a bucket and get the keys to connect to it
3. Run `pnpm dev` from the root directory to start the studio and the development servers for all packages.
4. Open the test studio at `http://localhost:3333`
   - You may need to adjust `test-studio/sanity.config.js` to include a new vendor or remove others while testing a specific one.

Any changes in the plugins or core package will be picked up by the test studio, with some level of hot module reloading.

On rules of conduct, I'm a newbie with collaborating on open-source, so no strict rules here other than **being respectful and considerate**.

### Cutting new releases

1. Run `pnpm run build` to build the packages to ensure builds are working and there are no Typescript errors
2. Bump the packages' versions via [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) by running `pnpm run changeset`
3. Run `pnpm run update-package-versions` to ensure all packages' versions are correctly updated
4. Run `pnpm run publish-packages` to publish the packages
